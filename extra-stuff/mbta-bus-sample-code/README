The MBTA and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation recently
released a trial real-time feed of the locations of MBTA buses on some
routes. Right now only the 39, 111, 114, 116, and 117 routes are
available from the MBTA. I'll add more routes as they're added by the
T.

This is a little mashup which takes that data and plots it on Google
Maps. Choose a bus route from the pull down menu below and markers
will appear with the latest locations of its buses. Red markers are
inbound buses, blue markers are outbound buses. Markers will update
with the latest information every 15 seconds.

It was built using Google App Engine and is about 50 lines of
JavaScript and 50 lines of Python. Not bad.

If you have any questions, comments, or pretty stylesheets, please
feel free to email (joe@joeshaw.org) or tweet (@joeshaw) them to me.
