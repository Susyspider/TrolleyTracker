The short story:

These KML files are originally derived from files on the MassDOT
web page, here:

    http://www.eot.state.ma.us/developers/

But they have been transformed to contain only the routes for a
given bus line.

The long story:

(1) Get the MBTA GTFS file from the URL above

(2) Get the Google Transit Data Feed tools from:

    http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/

(3) Run python/kmlwriter.py on the GTFS zip file, and after turning
    your laptop into a furnace it'll output a huge KML file containing
    all MBTA stops, stations and routes for all its modes of
    transportation.

(4) Run tools/generate-route-kml.sh <kml file> <route number> to
    generate the KML file
